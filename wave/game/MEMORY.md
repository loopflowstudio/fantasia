# Game memory

## North star

- Etude Fantasia grows toward Avatar Cube Team Sealed: two teams build three
  decks from shared pools, play the full three-by-three deck matchup matrix to
  five wins, and can study every recorded game afterward.
- Study is a named Game mode, not an independent product wave. Construction,
  play, replay, Retry, and comparison are one player loop.
- The Avatar starting values—540 cube cards, 135 cards per team, three
  40-card-minimum decks, unlimited basics, deck-specific sideboards, and five
  wins—are versioned format parameters rather than engine constants.
- The first robot team may use fixed authored decks. Manabots initially pilot
  without sideboarding; sealed-pool deck construction is an important later
  Intelligence capability, while drafting is separate.
- Discord is the assumed human communication layer. Do not build chat.
- This destination guides interfaces and sequencing but does not justify a
  speculative Team Sealed backlog before one polished play-to-Study loop works.

## Decisions

- Renamed from `gui` to `game` on 2026-07-15 because the wave owns the full
  playing experience, not a rendering technology.
- The experience target is Phase-level or better smoothness, performance,
  polish, reliability, and portability for creator-selected decks.
- Preserve Etude Fantasia's differentiators: visible AI identity, decision inspection,
  research-grade traces, replay, and a deliberately tiny curated product.
- The authority seam is `ExperienceFrame`, `InteractionOffer`/`Command`,
  `PresentationEvent`, and `RecoveryEnvelope`.
- Commands bind to revision + prompt + offer and carry a stable command ID.
- Presentation consumes semantic events; it does not infer meaning by diffing
  arbitrary snapshots.
- Canonical replay exposes a stable address for every historical player
  decision. Study may rank highlights, but it does not define or reconstruct
  the replay timeline.
- Offline command queues must not replay gameplay decisions into a newer state.
- Curated assets are versioned content, not opportunistic runtime fetches.
- WASM is deferred until adapter benchmarks show a product benefit.

## Evidence

- `docs/research/phase-experience.md`
- `docs/architecture/experience-protocol-v1.md`
- [Local challenger and shared-history evidence, 2026-09-25](../../docs/evidence/trained-challenger-2026-09-25.md)
- Legacy implementation notes in `01-play-interface.md` and `05-polish.md`
- Previous charter in `legacy-gui-charter.md`

## Open tensions

- Keep protocol design ambitious without blocking a thin vertical slice.
- Preserve the useful existing Svelte/FastAPI table while replacing its
  snapshot/action seam incrementally.
- Treat visual authorship as a product requirement without creating a generic
  content platform.

## Live advice carry-forward (2026-09-24)

The [unfinished live-advice design](../../docs/plans/live-belief-advice.md)
preserves ETU-14's pending work and release gates. The current checkout has
`ed2` pre-command decision addresses, immutable pending roots promoted to Study,
the Rules conditioning-index binding, and a selected tracked-posterior resolver.
Its focused tests cover address promotion, Counterspell support partitions, and
unsupported-world failure. The production `/api/advice` route still serves the
fixture; these seams do not close live advice or fresh live/Study byte parity.

Keep the decision address and viewer projection prefix independent of the
chosen Command. Authored Has/Lacks conditions and the tracked posterior have
separate provenance; probabilities remain server-private. Tracking must consume
all semantic transitions in order, including auto-passes. Snapshot loss makes
advice unavailable, never stalls Commands. Clone inputs under the table lock,
then perform likelihood/search in bounded background lanes. Validate participant
lease, viewer/audience, decision, advisor, compute, and source identities;
unavailable replies and late-response handling must clear old evidence.

Reuse DecisionAdvice and ActionPanel. The release proof requires fresh isolated
live/Study computations with identical canonical bytes, belief-only strategy
deltas, unchanged search roots, and responsive pilot/watcher Commands during
recomputation. The retained design budgets remain command P95 <=100 ms over 20
Commands, broadcast lag <=1 update, fresh advice P95 <=2 s / RSS <=512 MiB, and
cache hit <=50 ms on its declared profile; they were not remeasured here.

The old INT-7 checkpoint pin and quoted serving costs need revalidation under
the new loader ABI. Never repair drift by changing frozen evidence or substituting
a compatible prior. The earlier offline snapshot reported ETU-14 and ETU-21 open;
that is historical evidence, not the current queue. The 2026-09-25 Game status
describes ETU-14 as retired by the User. The retained advice design does not
authorize restarting it. Five checkpoint-advice checks still fail in the latest
affected-suite review; do not claim a passing ship gate.

## Trained opponent and shared history

[Challenge an identified trained bot through complete games · ETU-79](https://linear.app/loopflow/issue/ETU-79/challenge-an-identified-trained-bot-through-complete-games)
answers the User's practical question: “if right now were like alright lets
train our best sofar ...what do we do”. It also owns the training/export proof
formerly assigned to ETU-78. Use the [local operator workflow](../../docs/local-trained-challenger.md)
and its existing receipts; ETU-80 consumes those measurements. A small search-64
behavior-cloning run proves the workflow, not current strategic superiority.
Final proof requires repeated corrected-world executions after ETU-75 with exact
source capture, both deck assignments and legality/replay witnesses. Nearly zero
new spend remains the bound; no paid compute or public deployment is implied.

The User explicitly requested a global game log “across everyone,” both players
identified as Human/Bot, and easy filtering. My games is a filter on shared
history. Preserve two symmetric seat snapshots with stable public player IDs,
recorded names/decks and exact bot versions. Names, producer and loading path
are not identity; group bot versions only with declared lineage. Future graphs
and training datasets consume these structured records, not scraped UI text.

GameSession writes the existing Trace, attempt metadata and seats in one SQLite
transaction. Legacy JSON is read-only. Retain incomplete attempts and real ending
reasons; restart interruption does not invent a winner or human abandonment.
Resolve a generated deal seed before both policy and environment construction.
Validate replacements before closing the playable match and pin rematch identity.
Recorder failures must reach the player even if cleanup also fails.

New attempts have shared listings; completed shared replays use the established
seat-0 projection. Unfinished prefixes and feedback remain participant-only,
and historical private SQLite games remain private. Listing never grants Retry,
feedback or hidden live-state access. Keep public IDs separate from credentials,
filter permissions in SQL before pagination, and label automated validation by
origin rather than inferring human play from a Human seat.

The 2026-09-25 review proves built-browser integration, both trained-opponent
assignments, history/replay permissions and exact replay reconstruction. Human
feedback says the demo plays fine but Lesson selection and transitions need
work. Completion, saved in-product human feedback, replay visit and voluntary
return remain unconfirmed. ETU-75 owns the missing Lesson-pool world; ETU-77 owns
its usable interaction and ETU-76 transition clarity. Preserve exact reported
positions; automated play and an Ask session's existence do not prove those
outcomes. All three chapter KRs remain false in the current status.


## Consequence readability (ETU-76, 2026-10-04)

The existing live/replay presentation consumer now retains a bounded readable
semantic-event list after playback and skip, supports pause, and preserves
reading time under reduced motion. Current prompt actor/instruction is separate
from past-event narration. The board always shows the committed current frame.
See [presentation runtime](../../docs/architecture/presentation-runtime.md) for
fixture positions and scope. The original reported position is still unknown;
Bolt-only spell projection remains a known coverage gap. Fixture regressions and
automated checks do not close human-play or full-game recurrence acceptance.
Keep ETU-76 open for those outcomes.

Terminal visual captures must settle semantic narration explicitly: reduced
motion preserves reading time, and CSS animation suppression leaves JavaScript
beat timers running. PR #199's terminal failure was capture readiness, confirmed
by narration-only artifact diffs and a clock-controlled browser regression.
Keep the reference corpus and tolerances unchanged; focused macOS readiness
checks do not certify the full Linux release matrix.

## Large legal-choice navigation (ETU-77, 2026-10-05)

The current Learn surface already has the approved mode selector, previews and
Back; full native w4 Lesson retrieval is present. Preserve that interaction.
The bounded ETU-77 candidate adds optional label filtering to lists of eight or
more offers, retaining original IDs, duplicates, keyboard focus and ordinary
Commands. Updates/recovery clear local filtering. Exact native prefixes and
viewer frames cover nine targets, eight cleanup discards, ten Learn offers,
six block choices and an optional cost; see the
[coverage ledger and local walkthrough](../../docs/choice-navigation.md).
These new fixtures do not identify the original reported awkward position.
Search versus grouping, the threshold and duplicate-copy clarity still require
Jack Heart's play judgment; automated checks do not close ETU-77 or chapter KR2.
Model-facing decision contracts remain ETU-107's separate responsibility.
