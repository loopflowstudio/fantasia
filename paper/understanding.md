# What we actually know (and why)

The living document the Pacing rule gates on. One section per closed cycle:
*what was measured, why we believe the mechanism, what would change our
mind* — written for the owner at a whiteboard, not for reviewers. Terse is
fine; un-derivable is not. `main.tex` is a frozen v0.1 snapshot for eventual
publication; this file is the project's brain.

## Findings of 2026-07-10 (world w2 unless noted)

**F1 — Single-deal evaluation bug (instrument).** In worlds w0–w1, the
Python wrapper `manabot/env/env.py Env.reset(seed=)` accepted a seed but did
not propagate it to the Rust engine. Every evaluation that re-seeded via
`reset` therefore played all of its games on one deal (one shuffle, one pair
of opening hands). An N-game evaluation through that path measures N
stochastic rollouts of a single deal, not N games. Fixed 2026-07-10
(PR #51); source: `experiments/exp-06-newworld-training.md`. Evaluation
lineages that construct a fresh engine per game (the flat-MC matchup driver)
or step the Rust VectorEnv across auto-resets were not affected.

**F2 — Seat parity under random play (correction).** Deal-averaged
random-vs-random mirrors are at seat parity: on-the-play win rate 49.9%
(interactive deck) and 49.8% (standard deck), n≥1000 each
(`experiments/repro/data/repro_06_seat_parity.json`). The previously
recorded values (93.4% on-play standard; 23.1% on-play interactive,
"seat-advantage inversion") were single-deal artifacts per F1. All
pre-2026-07-10 per-seat claims are void unless re-derived deal-averaged.

**F3 — Retraction: no competence-emergent seat advantage established.** A
measurement of 68.9% seat-0 win rate in search-256 self-play (exp-10 datagen)
was traced to a training corpus containing 3 distinct deals across 225 games.
Deal-diverse data shows no clean seat pattern. The hypothesis "seat advantage
emerges with playing competence" is unsupported; it was briefly asserted on
2026-07-10 before the deal check completed, and is retracted.
Source: `experiments/exp-10-value-gate.md` (Deviation 3, Caveats).

**F4 — Representation growth is benign for training (exp-06/C6a).** Growing
the observation/action encoding from world w0 to w1 (card features 29→37,
action types 7→14, mid-resolution decision kinds added) does not degrade PPO
learning on the same game: 3 seeds of terminal-only reward on
INTERACTIVE_DECK score 69.3/77.3/73.5% deal-averaged seat-balanced vs a
uniform-random opponent, within or above the w0 reference band (60.0–75.5%).
Params +1.1%, training throughput +22% on the same recipe.

**F5 — The opponent installs the strategy (exp-11/C8).** With reward held
fixed (terminal-only) and only the training opponent varied, the learned
behavioral profile tracks the opponent: against a uniform-random opponent,
policies drift passive (passed_when_able up to 0.84, 283-step games);
against a frozen strong opponent, policies are forced into near-total
aggression (cast_when_able 0.86–0.89); in self-play, intermediate profiles.
Self-play produced the strongest policies on both vs-random and
search-ladder metrics among the three conditions (2 seeds/arm).
Source: `experiments/exp-11-curriculum-exploitability.md`.

**F6 — The distilled student is robust to a matched-budget exploiter
(exp-11/C8).** A from-scratch PPO exploiter trained specifically against the
frozen distilled policy `student_r0` (87% vs random, w1-ported), at the same
budget that produced all historical trained policies (262k steps), reaches
only 23.5–26.0% against it. At matched cost, the student is not farmable;
its search-ladder placement is not inflated by exploitable habits. Bound is
budget-relative: stronger exploiters remain untested.

**F7 — Search improves on even a near-broken value function (exp-10/C10,
the goal-4 gate).** Flat determinized search using a learned value head at
depth-0 leaves beats greedy one-step argmax over the same value head
60.25% [55.4, 64.9] (400 deal-diverse games) — despite the value head having
been trained on 3 distinct deals (F3). Search-over-V is a policy improvement
operator; the gate's pre-registered >55% bar is cleared with the full CI.

**F8 — A scalar value head is not a rollout substitute at this scale
(exp-10/C10).** The same value head fails as a leaf evaluator relative to
playing games out with uniform-random actions: value-search-64 loses 76.5%
of games to random-rollout search-64 at equal simulation count, and loses
61.5% even to random-rollout search-16 at approximate wall-clock parity
(per-leaf evaluation is only ~2.8x faster than a full random playout on this
engine, not the theorized ~40x). Value quality deal-diverse: Spearman 0.485
vs rollout ground truth, with ordering near noise (0.12–0.32) in undecided
mid-game states. Conclusion: at 100k parameters and this data scale, replace
neither rollouts nor the teacher with scalar V(observation); the indicated
next step is diagnosis (the 2x2 information-x-continuation ablation), not a
value-guided distillation loop.

**F9 — Reproduction suite, first certification pass (partial).** Of six
load-bearing claims converted to end-to-end reproduction scripts
(`experiments/repro/`), four have run and passed deal-averaged in w2:
search strength without learning (88.3/97.7/98.7% vs random at N=16/64/256,
monotone; 256 over 16 head-to-head 80.7%); control incompetence of the
search pilot (max scenario score 0.34 of a known-correct line; random
outperforms search on the two hold-scenarios); batched-inference throughput;
seat parity (F2). Two remain in flight (reward-shaping comparison;
distillation vs matched-cost PPO). A claim without a passing reproduction
script is provisional.

## Pooling and filtering (ETU-106, 2026-10-06, w4)

The [paired pooling/floor follow-up](../experiments/pooling-filter-followup.md#result--completed-2026-10-06)
changed optimization work without demonstrating stronger play. At 600 collection
updates every arm saw 153,600 learner transitions. Removing the .01 floor raised
token exposures from 15,102–19,028 to 38,400, yet its three endpoint score changes
were −1/+10/−12 points. The paired mean was −1.00 [−11.33, 10.33]; masked mean's
floor effect was +0.33 [−4.00, 4.33]. These wide three-seed intervals do not prove
equivalence. The sparse common-cost token difference points the other way.

A collection-update budget fixes sampled transitions, not retained optimization
work or elapsed cost. Removing the floor addresses that accounting difference;
it does not establish the floor as the cause of the earlier token scores. The
token also changes shared policy representations, so even an interaction would
not isolate the critic. More seeds and denser cost-aligned observations could
discriminate a repeatable effect; this completed allocation does not authorize
them. Preserve both unresolved results and the unchanged defaults.

## Critic coverage at fixed collection count (ETU-105, 2026-10-07, w4)

The [mini filter-scope screen](../experiments/ataraxos-technique-screen.md#mini-result--completed-2026-10-07)
kept quantile/floor, masked-mean scalar architecture, learning rule and schedules
fixed across three paired seeds. Training the critic on every collected row raised
mean wall cost by 45% at the same 317,440 transitions. Final held-out greedy changes
were +7/+7/−4 points: mean +3.33 [−4.33, 11.33], with paired seed/shared-deal
resampling. All 1,200 final/diagnostic and 2,400 monitoring games replayed exactly.
This allocation does not demonstrate that the extra critic work earns its cost.

The final endpoint and sparse common-cost monitoring contrasts point in different
directions, both uncertain. Equal collection counts do not fix optimizer exposure
or compute. Lower critic loss on differently selected rows does not establish better
calibration; the shared encoder also changes the policy. Actor-only stays unpromoted,
without an equivalence claim or extrapolation to sustained training. The notebook
regenerates from retained evidence, with all failed calibration attempts visible.
