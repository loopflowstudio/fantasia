"""Head-to-head arena between frozen trained policies on shared deals.

Every experiment so far scored a policy against scripted greedy. This runner
plays a fixed roster of trained checkpoints against each other, and against
greedy, on one shared set of deals, so the two measures can be compared
directly. See `experiments/head-to-head.md` for the protocol and reading rule.

Principal types and entry points:

- `ROSTER` and `PAIRINGS` are the frozen design: who plays, identified by
  checkpoint bytes, and which pairs meet.
- `admit` verifies every checkpoint's bytes and loads it through the ordinary
  loader, which rejects a checkpoint bound to a different world, content pack
  or input schema. Admission is all-or-nothing and happens before any game.
- `run` plays the schedule through the existing arena (`play_cell`), one unit
  (pairing, deal) at a time: four games covering both deck assignments and
  both seats. It owns the wall-time cap, the disk floor and `status.json`.
- `report` projects retained rows into per-pairing scores, per-entrant scores
  against greedy and the reference opponent, ratings, and the paired contrasts
  the protocol names. It is safe to run while games are still being played.

Data flow. Each unit is one directory under `units/` written by a single worker
process; `rows.json` appears only after its four games and their replay check
finish, so a present `rows.json` is a complete unit. Nothing is overwritten:
a rerun plays only units that have no directory yet.

Pairing. Units are scheduled deal by deal across all pairings, so every pairing
uses the same deal seeds and an interrupted run still has every pairing at
nearly the same depth. Policy sampling seeds derive from (pairing, deal,
player), so only the deal is shared between pairings, not the action noise.
