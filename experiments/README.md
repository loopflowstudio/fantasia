# experiments/

One experiment = one report (`exp-NN-<name>.md`). Raw data in `data/`.
Run provenance lives in the verify store (`.runs/verify.sqlite`).
**Runners:** the exp-specific driver scripts live in [runners/](runners/) —
`manabot/` keeps only reusable instruments.

## Discipline

1. **Build before diagnosing.** Primary experiments exercise a runnable agent,
   teacher, or training loop in the real engine. Use katas and ablations to
   resolve an observed ambiguity or choose between concrete next builds, not
   as admission tests before integration.
2. **Predict first, in git.** Question, numeric prediction, kill criteria,
   and cost cap are committed *before* the run. No pre-run commit → the
   result is exploratory, not evidence.
3. **Name the strongest confound.** Every report says how its result could
   be wrong and what would discriminate.
4. **Mechanism over aggregates.** "Can/cannot" claims need a behavioral
   probe (competency scenario, action-level stat, per-bucket metric) — win
   rates alone are strength claims only.
5. **Numbers trace.** Every number in any doc traces to a report; every
   report traces to store rows or data files. Refutations stay on the
   record, dated, never silently edited.
6. **Seeds are the unit.** Game-level CIs quantify one checkpoint's eval
   noise; claims about a *method* need independent training seeds and
   cross-seed uncertainty. Three seeds are three data points.
7. **Protect the instrument.** Engine determinism, throughput, state
   injection, and search primitives are what make experiments cheap —
   changes that break them are failing changes regardless of green tests.

## Index

[ETU-105 mini filter scope](ataraxos-technique-screen.md#mini-result--completed-2026-10-07):
actor-only gained +3.33 [−4.33, 11.33] points against held-out greedy at 45% extra
training cost; unpromoted. All 3,600 monitoring/final games replayed exactly.

[ETU-106 pooling × advantage floor](pooling-filter-followup.md#result--completed-2026-10-06):
2,400 replay-verified games; no demonstrated token or floor-removal strength
benefit, no equivalence claim, and both floor changes remain unresolved.

ETU-99's [remaining Ataraxos transfer protocols](ataraxos-transfer.md) map
delivered instruments to unexecuted sampler, search, distillation and robustness
studies. Proposed budgets are separate from ETU-91 and grant no execution authority.

| exp | question | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| [00](exp-00-decision-profile.md) / [00-cost](exp-00-cost-basis.md) / [00c](exp-00c-seat-balanced-baselines.md) | calibrate the instrument | 194 decisions/game; single-init baselines meaningless; $0.44/1M steps. ~~Per-seat findings (94%/23.1% on-play)~~ deal artifacts per exp-06 — deal-averaged random mirrors are at parity (repro_06) |
| [01](exp-01-c1-training.md) | does the shaped recipe survive a real deck? | no — 0/3 seeds; one seat-parasitic; `cast_when_able` flipped sign |
| [02](exp-02-flat-mc.md) | how much intelligence is free? | search-256 = 99% vs random at $0; every trained policy below N=16 |
| [03](exp-03-distillation.md) | is distillation cheaper than RL? | yes — 90.5% vs matched-cost PPO's 52.7%; ladder ≈ N=8 at 1ms |
| [04](exp-04-potential-shaping.md) | is bias-free dense signal possible? | shaping was the disease — terminal-only wins; pass-collapse fails replication |
| [07](exp-07-expert-iteration.md) | does the expert-iteration crank compound? | no — R1 loses 74–26 to R0 (label economics); batched inference 12× landed |
| [06](exp-06-newworld-training.md) | did observation growth hurt training? | benign — seeds in/above the historical band |
| [08](exp-08-two-deck-matchup.md) / [08b](exp-08b-ancestral-dose.md) | what decides a matchup table? | pilot + card quality — 4× Recall swung it 55 points; UR-22% was a pilot artifact |
| [09](exp-09-control-competency.md) | can the pilot play control? | no — ≤0.39 correct at any N; random beats search on 3/5 scenarios; win rate masks incapacity |
| [10](exp-10-value-gate.md) | does search-with-V beat V-greedy? | gate passes deal-diverse 60.25% [55.4, 64.9], but V loses to cheaper random-rollout search (P3 refuted); V's ordering near-noise in undecided positions; first battery + training corpus (3 deals/225g) were deal-narrow |
| [11](exp-11-curriculum-exploitability.md) | does a stronger opponent teach better? | self-play quietly wins; the opponent installs the strategy; student robust (exploiter ≤26%) |
| [W2-214](w2-214-structural-semantic-katas.md) | can a bounded structural encoder break the bag encoder's exact symmetry on five static semantic relations? | instrument valid; bag exactly 50%; relational arm learned order/hierarchy but failed the pre-registered trainability and cost gates — redesign optimization/capacity before interpreting the remaining katas |
| [ETU-87](etu-87-allies-lessons-balance.md) | which cards decide Allies versus Lessons? | exploratory — the 70–30 gap is in the lists (Random mirrors reproduce it); cutting White Lotus Reinforcements ×2 and Suki for lands gives UR Lessons 47.7% [45, 51] on w3; the revised Lessons list is worth ~13 points on w4 |

### Teacher program (W2-234)

| report | question | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| [teacher0](w2-234-teacher0.md) | can a search-supervised policy/value student learn from Teacher-0? | proceed to scale-up — joint policy/value matches policy-only CE/top-1, improves held-out value Brier 0.2536→0.2043, 71%→73% vs random |
| [teacher1](w2-234-teacher1.md) | does the determinized PUCT substrate work end-to-end? | substrate pass — tree search, node reuse, alternating backup, self-play shards all function; priors still uniform, playouts random |
| [teacher1-pilot](w2-234-teacher1-pilot.md) | do budgets 8/32/128 give strong, legal, affordable targets? | **preregistered, unrun** — fail-closed until the terminal Teacher-0 manifest and control lock exist |
| [INT-4 smoke](int-4-visit-teacher-smoke.md) | does the visit teacher → 2×2 students → four-agent arena → Study pipeline execute on real states? | engineering substrate pass, **not admission evidence** — 507 labels, exact 175-decision replay, four matched checkpoints, complete smoke arena, and cross-language Study validation; production controls and competencies remain |
| [INT-4 production harness](int-4-visit-teacher-production.md) | can the registered multi-seed iteration fail closed on exact controls and produce independently verified admission evidence? | harness ready, **production not run** — exact frozen Teacher-0 bytes are absent; no substitution or production claim |
| [INT-8 student signal guidance](int-8-student-signal-guidance.md) | should the recovered chosen-action or visit-distribution policy guide bounded PUCT? | `kill_retained_smoke_policy_guidance` — both arms lost paired score to uniform, added inference cost, and improved uniform-128 agreement by <0.05; one-seed smoke evidence only |

### Platform evidence (W2)

| report | claim proven |
|---|---|
| [card-conformance-audit](card-conformance-audit.md) | 55 registered cards audited vs Scryfall; 20 shell mismatches fixed; fixture + tripwire test |
| [milestone-1](milestone-1-two-deck-slice.md) | all four rules stages landed for the UR-Lessons-vs-GW-Allies slice |
| [opcode-alignment-v1](opcode-alignment-v1.md) | semantic-program-only encoder: 91.7% zero-shot held-out cluster accuracy vs 0.0% for opaque card-id arms |
| [structured-policy-decoder](structured-policy-decoder.md) | structured decoder matches legacy adapter exactly (6435/6435 actions) at comparable latency — migration evidence |
| [INT-11 semantic runtime policy](int-11-semantic-runtime-policy.md) | learned priority/target/combat policy executes 144 legal Commands and 36/36 terminal paired games across three seeds; identity transfer beats identity-only but matches structure-shuffled, so structure evidence is null/ambiguous |
| [INT-12 belief strategy advisor](int-12-belief-strategy-advisor.md) | one pinned exact-range comparison returns byte-identical live/Study advice with a 0.125 policy delta; cached p50 0.984 ms and fresh p50 16.981 s for the declared 16-simulation engineering profile, with no strength or service-SLO claim |
| [INT-17 belief calibration](int-17-belief-calibration.md) | exact frozen run retained a fail-closed systems result: per-row materialization re-enumerates the full support, making likelihood updates O(S²); optimistic full-trace projection 11.55h exceeded the 6h cap, so no curves or calibration claim exist pending RUL-13 and a new execution contract that preserves v1's scientific inputs while binding the repaired runtime |
| [w2-179](w2-179-content-pack-local-diagnostic.md) | immutable ContentPack / mutable Card seam with deterministic CardDefId hashing |
| [w2-182](w2-182-search-branching-v1.md) | full-clone branching baseline: 2,194 sims/s, clone p50 4.5µs |
| [w2-198](w2-198-compact-clone-undo-v1.md) | compact clone+undo at parity with full clone (2,097 sims/s) with journal accounting |
| [w2-208](w2-208-content-pack-clone-allocations.md) | exact clones share the immutable ContentPack by Arc pointer |
| [w2-215](w2-215-semantic-projection.md) | viewer projection baseline: ~53 tokens/object p50, ~9.9µs hot projection, zero failures |
| [w2-223](w2-223-typed-ir-interpreter.md) | generic fail-closed interpreter executes all 31 admitted programs by opcode — no card-name dispatch |

Distributed-RL research and the unexecuted bounded workload plan live in
[the ETU-108 report](../docs/distributed-rl.md). Its supervisor is in
[runners/distributed_benchmark.py](runners/distributed_benchmark.py); this is
benchmark preparation, not a completed two-host training experiment.
