# Head-to-head play between trained policies

Original cross-deck freeze (2026-10-09): queued on the M1 mini after the early
learning-rate screen, before results. The later MTG-131 request reports partial
cross-deck results; this document does not track that run's live status. This is **exploratory**:
one checkpoint per model, one training seed behind each, and no result here
changes a recipe by itself.

## Question

Every experiment this week scored a policy against scripted greedy. That score
is dominated by which deck the policy holds, and several checkpoints that
differ by tens of thousands of updates landed in the same band. Does playing
trained policies directly against each other, on the same deals, separate
models that the greedy score does not?

## Entrants

All checkpoints were loaded through the ordinary loader on the current world
(`w4`, pack `ur-lessons-vs-gw-allies`), which checks each checkpoint's content
manifest, deck setups and input schema against the runtime. The runner repeats
that admission, plus a byte check against the hashes below, before any game.

The three small-ladder checkpoints are one training run and its continuations,
so their ordering is a statement about that run. The update counts are the job
names' and were not re-derived from the run records. The roster in
[`head_to_head.py`](runners/head_to_head.py) is the authority; `roster` prints it.

Left out, with reasons:

- **Ataraxos campaign policies** (2026-10-04, self-play and search-distillation,
  seed 5601). They load and bind to the current world, so this is a budget
  choice, not an exclusion for incompatibility: they are a smaller, shallower
  model from short runs, and the untrained and 10,000-update entrants already
  cover the weak end.
- **ETU-118 seeds 11852 and 11853**, and the 26,000 and 63,000 averaged weights
  and the large model's averaged weights. One mini-baseline seed and one
  raw-against-averaged comparison, at the best checkpoint, are enough to ask
  the question.
- **ETU-125 seed 12552.** Its cross-deck arm was still training when this was
  frozen, so only seed 12551 has both arms.
- **Intermediate monitoring checkpoints** of the GPU runs. Retrievable, not
  needed for a first look.

## Schedule

Each pairing plays 100 deals. A deal is four games: both deck assignments, and
both seats within each, so each side holds each deck on the play and on the
draw once. That is **400 games per pairing**, on deal seeds
1,913,260,000-099, a namespace no other cohort uses. Every pairing uses the
same deals. Action sampling is seeded per pairing, so only the deal is shared.

25 pairings, 10,000 games:

- every entrant against scripted greedy (9);
- a full round robin among `small-26k`, `small-63k`, `small-100k`,
  `large-15k6` and `etu118-10k` (10);
- `small-100k-ema`, `small-0`, `etu125-cross-10k` and `etu125-mirrors-10k`
  each against `small-100k`, the candidate frozen opponent (4);
- `etu125-mirrors-10k` against `etu125-cross-10k`, and `etu118-10k` against
  `etu125-cross-10k` (2).

Policies sample from their action distribution, one CPU thread, as in
monitoring. Units are played deal by deal across all pairings, so a run that
stops early has every pairing at the same depth.

## What is reported

`uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head report <run>` prints, from
retained rows, and is safe to run while games continue:

- per pairing: the first-named side's score (a draw counts half), split by the
  deck it held and by play or draw;
- nine named contrasts, each giving two numbers for the same two entrants on
  the same deals: the difference of their greedy scores, and their direct
  score minus 50;
- a rating per entrant on an Elo scale with greedy at zero (the arena's
  existing Bradley-Terry fit with a seat term).

Every interval is 95% and resamples whole deals, keeping a deal's four games
together, and for the contrasts keeping the same deal across the pairings
being compared. A pairing with any invalid game (timeout, crash, failed
replay) gets no score rather than a score over the survivors.

## What 400 games can resolve

If games were independent, a pairing near 50% has a standard error of 2.5
points: a 95% half-width of about 5, enough to detect a true 57-43 edge about
four times in five. The four-game deal block usually does better because it
cancels deal and deck luck: ETU-118's final evaluations of this design (100
deals against greedy) had half-widths of 2.4 to 3.3 points. A difference of
two greedy scores is about 1.4 times wider than one. The deck and seat splits
are 200 games each, about 7 points either way at worst: descriptive only.

## Reading rule

Fixed before any result exists. For each of the nine contrasts, call the
direct result *decided* if its interval excludes 50, and the greedy result
*decided* if the interval of the greedy-score difference excludes zero.

- **Head-to-head adds information** if at least three contrasts are decided
  directly and undecided by greedy, or if any contrast is decided both ways
  with opposite signs. Nine intervals at 95% produce about one false decision
  in two runs by chance, which is why one or two do not count.
- **Head-to-head adds nothing** if no contrast is decided directly and
  undecided by greedy, and the rating order matches the greedy-score order
  wherever adjacent entrants' intervals do not overlap.
- Otherwise **unresolved**.

Also report, without a threshold, the ratio of each contrast's direct effect
to its half-width beside the same ratio for the greedy difference. That is the
plain measure of which instrument is more sensitive per game.

What would be surprising:

- the 26,000 / 63,000 / 100,000 ladder separating directly by 10 points or
  more per step when their greedy scores do not: training kept improving play
  that greedy could not see;
- an inversion: the entrant with the clearly higher greedy score losing the
  direct meeting. That would mean the greedy score rewards exploiting greedy;
- `large-15k6` beating `small-100k` directly on a sixth of the updates;
- the averaged weights differing from the raw ones by more than 5 points
  either way;
- `small-0` scoring above 20% against `small-100k`. Untrained policies score
  about 28 to 30% against greedy; if a trained policy cannot do much better than
  that against an untrained one, head-to-head has little range at the bottom.

## Decision it informs

Whether the next training comparison should score checkpoints against a frozen
trained opponent, with `small-100k` as the first candidate, alongside or
instead of scripted greedy. "Adds information" argues for adding the frozen
opponent to monitoring and keeping greedy as the anchor to earlier work.
"Adds nothing" argues for leaving monitoring as it is. Secondary: whether the
averaged export is worth evaluating, and whether the ETU-125 arms look
different when they meet.

## What this cannot show

One checkpoint per model and one seed behind each: a difference between two
entrants is about those two files, not their recipes. The entrants come from
several source revisions and two value-head variants. A frozen opponent is itself
a single point; beating `small-100k` is not general strength, and a policy
could learn to exploit it as readily as greedy. The ratings come from an
incomplete schedule and lean on the model for pairs that never met.

## Execution

- Host: M1 mini (4 performance and 4 efficiency cores), CPU inference only,
  four worker processes, one game process per worker. No cloud calls.
- Why it queues instead of running alongside: on 2026-10-09 08:06 PDT the
  host's load average was 3.9 with the ETU-118 final evaluation running, so its
  performance cores were already taken; a two-worker smoke at the lowest
  priority raised the one-minute load to about 6. The learning-rate screen's
  waiter also refuses to start while any experiment runner is alive, so
  overlapping its handoff would delay it. This run starts only after that
  screen reaches a terminal status and no experiment process remains.
- Expected cost: the mini smoke measured 3.2 to 4.1 s per game between small
  models and 7.2 s with the large model, at the lowest priority on a busy
  host. At those rates the full schedule is about 3.5 hours on four workers;
  an idle host should be faster.
- Bounds: the runner stops admitting games at 6 hours and reports the run
  incomplete; the waiter kills it at 6.5 hours. Each game is capped at 120 s
  and 10,000 commands. The run stops if free disk falls below 40 GiB;
  projected use is about 0.3 GiB.
- Failure: admission is all-or-nothing before the first game. A unit whose
  worker fails is retained as failed and never replayed. The exit status is
  non-zero unless every unit finished with every game valid.
- Source: a clone on the mini at this document's commit, `main` at `73e73aa7`
  plus this experiment. The native library is the one built for that engine
  source (SHA-256 `9e3be349...0da677`).
- The waiter is a shell loop started with `nohup`; it does not survive a
  reboot, and neither does the run. It reads the learning-rate screen's status
  file and the process table and touches nothing else outside its own
  directory.

## Smoke

Not findings. Two deals (8 games) for each of four pairings, to prove loading,
pairing, replay and the report. Run on the laptop and again on the mini; the
two hosts produced identical score tables, as they should from identical seeds.
The starting player's opening hand was identical across all four pairings on
each deal and deck assignment, which is the shared-deal claim checked directly.
All 32 games were valid and replayed.

## Mirror-only follow-up (MTG-131, 2026-10-09)

Jack Heart requested same-deck head-to-heads to separate deck-specific skill from
cross-deck advantage. The cross-deck protocol and evidence above remain unchanged.
The mirror follow-up is implemented but **the full run has not started here**;
Jack Heart's training manager owns execution on the Mini after the current
head-to-head finishes. No running experiment is changed by this follow-up.

### Frozen schedule and interpretation

`--matchups mirrors` keeps the same ten entrants and **25 scheduled pairings**,
not a new 45-pair round robin. This is the implementation assumption for “redo
the head-to-heads”: all deck/seat combinations within the existing schedule,
not an independently approved expansion of the model pairings.
Every pairing receives the same 100 deal seeds,
**1,913,131,000–1,913,131,099**, reserved for MTG-131 and disjoint from the
cross-deck and existing study/monitoring cohorts. Each deal has four games:

| leg | matchup | player A |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | Lessons vs Lessons | on the play |
| 5 | Lessons vs Lessons | on the draw |
| 6 | Allies vs Allies | on the play |
| 7 | Allies vs Allies | on the draw |

That is 10,000 games, 200 per deck per pairing (100 per deck/seat split).
No cross-deck games are replayed. Deal seeds specify the same per-seat shuffle
across pairings, while action noise remains seeded per pairing and player.

Every trained model except **`etu125-mirrors-10k`** was trained only on Lessons
vs Allies: same-deck games are outside its training matchups. `small-0` is
untrained; scripted greedy remains the code anchor. Mirror transfer is a property
of these frozen checkpoints, not a multi-seed learning-method result.

The report gives separate Lessons and Allies panels: each pairing's score and
play/draw splits, the existing direct/greedy contrasts, and a separate seat-aware
Bradley-Terry fit with greedy at zero. Each 95% bootstrap resamples whole deals,
keeping both seats together and sharing sampled deal blocks across pairings.
Invalid games and failed/unfinished units are counted explicitly; any such unit
suppresses that pairing's estimates on **both** decks and excludes it from
contrasts/ratings. This conservative whole-unit rule does not silently score the
survivors. Partial runs show their completed deal counts; missing scheduled deals
are not a completed cohort. Two smoke deals establish no strength or uncertainty
precision. The cross-deck reading rule is not a multiplicity-adjusted claim for
these two exploratory panels, nor does its four-game precision estimate apply
to a two-game per-deck block.

Mirror execution explicitly admits repetition of exact checkpoint roster decks
**and sideboards**, never arbitrary cards. It carries the original compiled pack
through native reset and retained replay; a same-deck list alone must not fall
back to the generic registry. Checkpoint bytes and their ordinary load admission
are unchanged. Belief checkpoints remain unsupported for this mirror option.
Omitting `--matchups` retains the original cross-deck behavior and identities.

### Commands and bounded smoke

Use the native library rebuilt from this branch, not a cross-deck-only checkout's
extension. The models directory contains the exact filenames/hashes in the roster.
Use a fresh output directory: cross-deck and mirror designs cannot share one.

```bash
# Bounded local proof only: 2 deals × 3 pairings × 4 mirror legs = 24 games.
uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head smoke .runs/mtg131-mirror-smoke \
  --models .runs/mtg131-models --matchups mirrors --workers 1 --wall-seconds 600
uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head report .runs/mtg131-mirror-smoke

# Training-manager handoff only; NOT launched by this implementation.
uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head run .runs/mtg131-mirrors \
  --models /path/to/models --matchups mirrors --workers 4
```

The mirror smoke uses **1,913,131,100–101**, separate from scoring, and compares
`etu125-cross-10k`, `etu125-mirrors-10k`, and scripted greedy. It exercises saved
model admission, trained-vs-trained play, both greedy comparisons, every deck/seat,
exact replay, direct contrasts and deck ratings. It does not measure large-model
mirror cost; Mini runtime and the full roster remain the manager's responsibility.
The existing six-hour admission cap, 120-second/10,000-command game bounds and
40-GiB disk floor remain unchanged. Timing is workflow evidence, not strength or
an uncontended Mini throughput estimate.

The local arm64 smoke completed on 2026-10-09 in **83.70 seconds wall** with
one worker: 24/24 valid games, 2,960 decisions, zero failed units or integrity
errors, and exact replay throughout. Summed per-game time was 72.81 seconds
(**3.03 s/game**, including game-process startup; replay/coordinator work is
additional). Both deck reports include the ETU-125 direct contrast and greedy-zero
ratings. Reconstructed opening hands agreed across all three pairings and both
legs in each of eight (deal, deck, seat) groups. This is not a strength result.

Original design, rows, traces, replay receipts and reports remain in
`.runs/mtg131-mirror-smoke`; its `smoke-receipt.json` binds them by SHA-256
(`8356e32d9e134d7199f7caa67d7a01b3b0cd6016c55588c62ab7b60f7ba59635`).
The receipt also pins runner/arena source and the rebuilt native extension.
Those source hashes match `001e6920`, before the shared leg-layout simplification
in `0e1d0e57`. Offline reconciliation on 2026-10-09 verified all 28 retained file
hashes and reproduced the saved JSON/text report with the simplified code;
it did not rerun games or replace the original smoke's source identity.
Host load was high and changed during the smoke; do not extrapolate this rate
as uncontended Mini throughput. No large-model mirror timing or full-roster
result is claimed.

## Roster files (MTG-134, 2026-10-10)

Jack Heart approved Mini head-to-head evaluation of the size × advantage-floor
grid because scripted-greedy scores compress above about 0.65. The initial
[grid roster](rosters/size-floor-grid.json) pins greedy and three final raw
26,000-update, seed-10351 checkpoints in a full round robin. It declares floor
at width 64 and width at floor 0.01 contrasts, with `w64-floor010` as reference.
These are checkpoint comparisons, not independent-seed method estimates.

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head smoke .runs/grid-smoke \
  --models /path/to/models --roster experiments/rosters/size-floor-grid.json
# Operator-owned Mini evaluation; use a separate directory from the smoke.
uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head run .runs/grid-cross \
  --models /path/to/models --roster experiments/rosters/size-floor-grid.json
uv run python -m experiments.runners.head_to_head report .runs/grid-cross
```

Use `--matchups mirrors` with a separate output directory for same-deck play.
Custom smoke uses the entire selected schedule on two deals; it does not
automatically launch the full evaluation. No flag preserves the original
built-in schedule, arena versions and historical report format.

The strict JSON model is `RosterSpec` in the runner. Required fields are
`entrants`, `core`, `extra`, `contrasts`, `reference` and
`training_caveat`. Checkpoint entrants require `id`, `label`, `origin`,
`file`, `sha256`, `bytes`, `training_seed` and `updates`. Files are basenames
relative to `--models`; hashes and positive sizes bind exact checkpoint bytes.
The required `scripted-greedy` entrant has only id, label and origin (checkpoint
fields may be null). IDs follow arena registration naming: 3–64 lowercase
letters, digits or hyphens, starting with a letter or digit. Unknown fields,
coercible wrong types, unknown IDs, self-pairs, duplicate unordered pairings,
missing reference and unscheduled contrasts fail before games.

Every checkpoint meets greedy automatically. `core` adds a round robin;
including greedy in core is allowed and does not duplicate those automatic
meetings. `extra` adds explicit pairs; do not repeat core or greedy pairs.
Contrast pairs must be scheduled checkpoint meetings; their order determines
the reported subtraction. Greedy remains the rating zero, distinct from the
named reference opponent.

The run saves the actual specification in `design.json`; reporting needs no
roster file. To append the remaining grid cells when their final bytes exist,
append entrants and core IDs (or extra meetings), then rerun the same command.
Existing oriented pairs, entrant fields, reference, caveat, contrasts,
deal seeds, runtime registrations and game bounds must remain unchanged.
New contrasts may be appended. Changing pair orientation is not an extension:
it changes action seeds. Completed units retain their files and only missing
directories are scheduled; failed/unfinished directories remain failures, not
silent retries. A new invocation has its own explicit wall cap.

The operator still owns appending `w32-floor003`, `w128-d4-floor003` and
`w128-d4-floor010` with their actual seed-10352 receipts and running the Mini
evaluation. This software Task launches no full cohort.
